# Fish Against Education (FAE) Foundation Landing Page

The FAE Foundation Landing Page is a nonsensical, fun webpage. 

## Background
A school of fish have discovered that overfishing is positively correlated with how educated humans are. In an effort to save their fellow fishes, they create an environmental organization that advocates for the "un-education" of humans.
